<h1 align="center">🐍 Python Programs Repository</h1>
<p align="center">
  A collection of my Python practice programs — written throughout my learning journey.
</p>

<h2>📘 About This Repository</h2>
<p>
  This repository exists to store and organize the various programs I create while learning and experimenting with Python. 
  These scripts are general in nature and focus on understanding concepts rather than performing any specialized real-world functionality.
</p>

<h2>💡 Why This Repository Exists</h2>
<p>
  As I progressed through my Python learning journey, I realized the need for a single safe place where I could store, revise, and revisit all of my code without risking data loss or scattered files across different devices. 
  This repository solves that problem by becoming a reliable home for every program I write — accessible anytime, anywhere.
</p>

<h2>🚀 Purpose</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To track my learning progress in Python.</li>
  <li>To keep practice programs organized in one place.</li>
  <li>To ensure my code remains backed up, safe, and accessible.</li>
  <li>To reflect on my growth as a programmer over time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧩 Notes</h2>
<p>
  Each file you see here represents a step forward in my Python journey — 
  from basic syntax and logic exercises to exploring deeper concepts in programming.
